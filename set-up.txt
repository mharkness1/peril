You'll need to manually recreate any declared exchanges.
Rabbit normally persists them to disk.

For simplicity of our game, we'll make our transient and durable queues always have the same properties:

    "Durable" queues in our system will always be non-exclusive and non-auto-delete.
    "Transient" queues will always be exclusive and auto-delete.
